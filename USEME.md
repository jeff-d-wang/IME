  - Conditions:
    - `NAME-OF-SCRIPT.txt` must be a valid path to a pre-existing text file
- ### Component:
  - Create a greyscale image with the pre-notion component of the image with the given name, and

      - green
      - blue
      - value

      - luma
    - `image-name` must be a previously loaded or altered image
    - `dest-image-name` must not contain spaces to be assigned correctly
- ### Flip:
  - Flip an image to create a new image, referred to henceforth by the given destination name.
  - Format: `TYPE-flip image-name dest-image-name`
  - Example: `horizontal-flip smallImage res/smallImage/result/smallImage-horizontal-flip.ppm`
  - Conditions:
    - `TYPE` is any of the following supported flip types:
      - horizontal
      - vertical
    - `image-name` must be a previously loaded or altered image
    - `dest-image-name` must not contain spaces to be assigned correctly
- ### Brighten:
    - Brighten the image by the given increment to create a new image, referred to henceforth by the
  given destination name. The increment may be positive (brightening) or negative (darkening).
    - Format: `brighten increment image-name dest-image-name`
    - Example: `brighten 10 smallImage res/smallImage/result/smallImage-brighten-by-10.ppm`
    - Conditions:
        - `increment` must be a number
        - `image-name` must be a previously loaded or altered image
        - `dest-image-name` must not contain spaces to be assigned correctly
- ### Blur:
  - Blur an image to create a new image, referred to henceforth by the given destination name.
  - Format: `blur image-name dest-image-name`
  - Example: `blur smallImage res/smallImage/result/smallImage-blur.ppm`
  - Conditions:
    - `image-name` must be a previously loaded or altered image
    - `dest-image-name` must not contain spaces to be assigned correctly
- ### Sharpen:
  - Sharpen an image to create a new image, referred to henceforth by the given destination name.
  - Format: `sharpen image-name dest-image-name`
